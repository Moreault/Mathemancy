# Mathemancy
A bundle for generic geometry types such as Vector2&lt;T>, Size&lt;T> and Rectangle&lt;T>

Have you ever had the pleasure of working with a game engine that had types such as RectangleFloat or RectangleInt? I have! And I find it kind of annoying. If only there was a way to have a generic Rectangleâ€¦

There is!

Have you ever wanted Size and/or Vector types? We have that too!

This library is still small but will (probably) get bigger with time.

Most (all of it, really) of the logic for generic numeric operators was adapted to .NET 6 from Marc Gravell and Jon Skeet's https://jonskeet.uk/csharp/miscutil/
